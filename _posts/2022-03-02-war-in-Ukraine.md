The occupier from the Russian Federation came to my native country. He kills people and destroys cities, strikes and fires at apartment buildings, uses vacuum bombs and vicious attacks on my homeland. The occupier made a mistake and entered our land on February 24, 2022. This post didn't come out earlier because blogging wasn't a priority these days.

It is always difficult to write about the war, especially for me, a person who does not know how to do it, but I will try to explain the situation in my homeland. I would like people from all over the world to correctly understand everything that is happening in Ukraine from the mouth of the person who is here.

The military campaign began after a long build-up of Russian troops in November 2021 along Ukraine's border with Russia and Belarus and the recognition by Russian authorities on February 21, 2022 of terrorist groups in Ukraine - "DNR" and "LNR" - as state entities. Various media outlets, Western and Ukrainian politicians have repeatedly viewed the accumulation of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border as Russia's preparation for war with Ukraine. Almost simultaneously, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation began the undisguised transfer of additional troops to the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

List of weapons used by Russia in shelling residential buildings.
* <strong>[Iskander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander)</strong> - In this <strong>ðŸ”¥[video](https://youtube.com/shorts/SLDq1tICyR8?feature=share)</strong>, the rocket was fired from the Belgorod region, which landed in the Cherkasy region of Ukraine.
* <strong>[TOS-1 Buratino/TOS-1A Solntsepyok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOS-1)</strong> - In this <strong>ðŸ”¥[fragment](https://youtu.be/R4d5vZ3R0gw)</strong> you can see the shelling in the city of Kharkiv with TOS-1A Solntsepyok.
* <strong>[BM-21 Grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM-21_Grad)</strong> - There is a shelling of Kharkiv from BM-21 Grad, go to <strong>ðŸ”¥[view](https://youtu.be/zvUNAzTC-AI)</strong>.
* <strong>[Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_All_Bombs)</strong>  - Russia used this bomb in Kharkov, video of the explosion you can see by following the <b><strong>ðŸ”¥[link](https://youtu.be/_GDAyOvBg-M)</strong>

Of course, this is not a complete list of weapons used. According to the State Emergency Service, more than 2,000 civilian Ukrainians have died in the past seven days of the war. Russia has destroyed groups of transport infrastructure, housing, hospitals and kindergartens. According to the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights, 21 children have died and 55 more have been injured since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

You can see the consequences of air strikes on Kharkiv in these photos.

You have seen the consequences of the shelling of Kharkiv, but air strikes are being carried out in many cities of Ukraine. Adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs Anton Gerashchenko on Facebook published a list of local explosions in the regions of Ukraine, provided by the National Police of Ukraine:

* Lutsk - information about explosions;
* Odesa - explosion of a locator near the airport;  
* Zaporozhye - an explosion near the airport;
* Mykolayivka, Chernihiv region - report on the movement of equipment from the Russian Federation;
* Myrhorod, Poltava region - explosion of two missiles;
* Kalanchak, Kherson region - shelling of border guards;
* Znamyanka, Kirovohrad region - shelling of a military unit;
* UDSNS Airport, Chernihiv Region - hitting the locator (there are victims);
* Starokostiantyniv, Khmelnytsky region - shelling of a military airport;
* Podolsk, Odesa region - 2 planes flew in from Transnistria, shelling;
* Ozerne, Zhytomyr region - rocket fire, one plane destroyed;
* Tulchyn and Teplyk, Vinnytsia region - explosions on;
* Ivano-Frankivsk region - shelling;
* Kharkiv - shelling; 
* Zaporozhye - on the outskirts of the shelling of the military unit;
* Kyiv region (Vasylkiv, Boryspil, Brovary, Polissya districts) explosions;
* Novyi Kalyniv village, Lviv region - shelling of the fuel and lubricants base;
* Revne, Kyiv region - shelling of a military unit;
* Chongar and Kalanchak, Kherson region - shelling of a military unit.

And this list is constantly updated, as this list was compiled on the first day of the war (February 24). I suggest viewing photos of the shelling of Kyiv.

The zombie people of Russia report that Ukrainian troops are shelling their homes. The whole world should know what Russia, which has invaded our land, is doing. We are defending our own homeland!

### Propaganda

Russian President Putin and Russian propaganda call Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine, which is accompanied by Russia's invasion of Ukraine's southern, eastern and northern borders, a "special military operation in the Donbas" to "demilitarize and denationalize Ukraine. Neo-Nazism is a major theme of pro-Russian propaganda and is attributed to the current Ukrainian government and its allies. In fact, there are no signs of Nazism in Ukraine, including territorial ambitions, state-sponsored terrorism, unbridled anti-Semitism, bigotry, and dictatorship. Putin also said that NATO countries support neo-Nazis.

Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Communications has called on a number of media outlets to remove "inaccurate information about a special military operation by the Russian Armed Forces to protect Donbass." Later, at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office, Roskomnadzor blocked access to the Internet resources of the Echo of Moscow radio station and the Dozhd TV channel. The Nastoyaschee Vremya TV channel, created by Radio Svoboda with the participation of Voice of America, Echo of Moscow radio station, The Village radio station, Taiga.info, DOXA, DOXA, The New Times and a number of Ukrainian TV channels, was also blocked. publications.
Deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation approved in the first reading amendments to the Criminal Code to 15 years in prison for "misinformation about the actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in military operations."
