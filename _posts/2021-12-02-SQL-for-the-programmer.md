I recently started studying databases, namely SQL. Based on this, I want to share with you the information I learned during my studies. I will continue to write about this topic, as it is impossible to describe everything in one post. I would also like to say in advance that I view databases from a programmer and how to use them for a programmer. This will not be a technical guide that will help you learn SQL, but I hope that I can interest people who know nothing about databases and perhaps show something new to people who work with them.
