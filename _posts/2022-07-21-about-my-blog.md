11 months ago, I decided to develop a pet project. I mainly program in C Sharp, so I didn't have to think long about the choice of technologies for development. Since [ASP.Net Core MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Core) is quite widespread, I thought it would be a good addition to my resume.

Also, it could demonstrate my skills in testing, "devopsing", development and in general the whole stage of creating a product, maybe not perfect, with simple functionality and implementation, but a finished product. I allocated a period of one month for the development of the working version. This term included the development of the interface, database, architecture, as well as writing the code and testing it. I also set aside a few days to familiarize myself with available cloud technology solutions for my product deployment. One of the main advantages for me was the simplicity, clarity of the UI and the trial period.


The choice fell on Google Cloud Platform, because at that time I already had some experience with Amazon Web Services. After reading several interesting stories about how a developer wrote a not very successful script, after which his servers worked at full capacity for a day, by the way, this script cost him 20 thousand dollars, I was frankly scared to upload my project to AWS. So I signed up for Google cloud platform and got $200 free for 90 days to buy a virtual server on Linux.

By the way, these funds were not enough for me for a short time, for about two months. But during this time I was able to fix the server and improve my site to an acceptable appearance. After the trial period, it's time to pay a lot of money for hosting. But I decided to turn off the server, cancel the subscription and abandon the project indefinitely. By the way, you can check out the source code of the ASP.Net Core blog by following this [link](https://github.com/WarmingZ/MyWebSite).

But the topic of this post is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). So, I moved my site to the Jekyll static site generator and deployed it to GitHub Pages, absolutely free by the way!
Now let's recall all the stories about AWS and Google Cloud Platform that I described above and ask ourselves, do we need different services and clouds to host our home projects?

Of course, Jekyll is just a generator of static pages, but you have no idea what opportunities and advantages it can provide you. Of course, I've been developing my blog for a GitHub portfolio. But the beauty and simplicity of Jekyll is stunning. By the way, in my blog on ASP.Net Core, I developed an admin panel in which I embedded a text editor [CKeditor](https://ckeditor.com) with a lot of features. But even now I have an admin panel that I connected as a Jekyll plugin, and I can access it via the Internet and change my posts.

If you want to start your blog, or create a page for your software product with a description and documentation, you can safely use Jekyll and GitHub Pages for this. To try it out, visit [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), where you can find detailed documentation on how to use it.

Jekyll is a really nice tool that works very well on GitHub servers. Since this is a generator of static pages, the user, opening your site in the browser, receives an HTML page that was generated by jekyll on the GitHub server, so the speed of work will be amazing. Of course, if you follow several rules of frontend development, for example, do not use Jpeg or PNG image format, which will take a long time to load when opening your site and the user will see the image loading from top to bottom. Of course, all this can be configured in the rules for uploading content, or something, there are a lot of options. By the way, if you download almost any picture from this site, you will see that it will have a WebP extension.

I have developed more than one site using ASP.Net Core MVC. But if you really just want to run your blog, or create a nice page with your product documentation, you won't find a better option than Jekyll. You can check out my projects by visiting my [GitHub](https://github.com/WarmingZ?tab=repositories) account, or by [link](https://github.com/WarmingZ/WarmingZ.github .io) you can familiarize yourself with the files and code of this site.
