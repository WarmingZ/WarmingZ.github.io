Hi, in this post I would like to share interesting sites with you. Some work with a neural network, and some are just cool😉.Consider this post as the top cool sites that vryatli once can be useful in real life, [**but if you like looking at cats, then why not**](https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/)😏 (just refresh the page). In the end, I also wanted to talk a little about neural networks and what it is for a programmer.

### [ClipDrop](https://clipdrop.co/) - create professional product visuals without a photo studio🔥
This neural network transfers objects from your smartphone camera to your computer. You can click on the title and you will be taken to the site. There you will see an example of how this application works. In order to try it, you need to download the application to your phone and computer. To connect  the mobile and the desktop, you just need to login with the same method on both device. For instance if you used the "Google sign in methods", you should sign in with this methods on both devices.

💡**The app is currently in closed beta testing, but you can easily fill out a google form to   give you access to pre-release testing.**

### [Disappearing](https://disappearing-people.glitch.me/) - removing people from complex backgrounds in real time using TensorFlow🔥🔥
A simple neural network using the TensorFlow library. Just turn on the camera and wait a little. The longer you move in front of the camera, the better you will be cut out of the background.This is a great demonstration of how neural networks work.🤟
I also mentioned that TensorFlow is used here. TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. 
If you are interested, you can go to the [github project repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) where the source code is located and install it into your project.💪

### [Image Inpainting](https://www.nvidia.com/research/inpainting/) - lets you edit images with a smart retouching brush🔥
This application uses the power of NVIDIA GPUs and deep learning algorithms to replace any portion of the image. You can upload your photo there and retouch it, or even cut out entire objects. I do not know how innovative this application is, because such functions are already provided by Google algorithms in the [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=uk&gl=US) smartphone application. In this application, you can also perform such retouching.

But it's still very interesting, here's how I cut myself out of the background:

Agree, it looks good. Of course, this can be done much more carefully. Try it!👍

### [Gnod](https://www.gnod.com/) - gives recommendations on the data you give 🔥🔥🔥
This service can help solve the problem "what to see?", "What to listen to?", "What to buy?", "What to read?" and may even recommend seeing pictures that you might like. When you get to the site, choose a category. Here are the categories to choose from:
* GNOD Music 
* GNOD Products
* GNOD Art
* GNOD Literature
* GNOD Movies

For example, let's choose the category of movies. Gnod will ask you to fill out a short form of your preferences and based on this will make recommendations to you.😮

### [Emupedia](https://emupedia.net/beta/emuos/) - great site to play old games 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
By going to this site you will be stuck on it for a long time (as it was with me).It provides a great opportunity to remember and play old games. Please log in from your computer, as it is terrible on smartphones.
When you get to the site, choose an operating system and play, it's really cool!👍👍
Here is a screenshot of the desktop with game icons:

You can even play Doom and Quake!🤯

### A little about neural networks🌎 💤
Back in 1943, the first model of an artificial neural network was invented by an American neurophysiologist, one of the fathers of cybernetics, [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch), and a neurolinguist, logician and mathematician [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts). Their idea was that neurons are devices operating in binary numbers, a kind of simplest processors connected to each other.
Already in 1957, the famous American scientist in the field of psychology and neurophysiology, [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt), developed the perceptron - a model of information perception by the brain based on a learning neural network. A couple of years later, he created a working machine, the Mark-1, the first neurocomputer. He was able to recognize some of the letters written on cards that were brought up to his camera eyes.
#### My opinion😉
From the above, we can already say that the idea of neural networks is not new for a long time. But it has been gaining popularity in recent years due to the expanding computer industry.
I cannot share with everyone this hype about piece intelligence. Since it seems to me that now he is at a fairly low level of development. All businessmen are used to talking about neural networks to maximize profits. Look at any development in which there is even a word about a neural network and you will see that it really attracts investments from people who do not understand what it is about at all.

### How artificial intelligence can help a programmer❓
Understand, at this stage I cannot say that I am a professional programmer, so you should not rely on my words. I believe that artificial intelligence (now) cannot replace the programmer, but it can help emu in development. I formed this opinion after looking at the report of [Yegor Bugaenko](https://www.yegor256.com/) (this link leads to his blog).
For me as a programmer, it would really be cool if artificial intelligence could help me do unit tests and validate my code, give me advice or something like that.
Of course, he will analyze millions of lines of code and give me recommendations based on this. How does google or youtube give me recommendations based on my preferences. Even if he could decompose the problem for me, it would greatly simplify development and save time.

This post was written with the intention of drawing some attention to my blog. I also encourage you to write me comments and like👍 if you liked what you read.
Also write what you think about neural networks in the comments, it will be very interesting to me! See you in the next post🙂🖐️
