I"Æ<p>I recently started studying databases, namely SQLğŸ¤“. Based on this, I want to share with you the information I learned during my studies.<a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/"><img src="/img/posts/Database/SQL.png" style="width:128px;max-width:100%;" align="right" /></a> I will continue to write about this topic, as it is impossible to describe everything in one post. I would also like to say in advance that I view databases from a programmer and how to use them for a programmerğŸ‘¨â€ğŸ’». This will not be a technical guide that will help you learn SQL, but I hope that I can interest people who know nothing about databases and perhaps show something new to people who work with them.</p>
