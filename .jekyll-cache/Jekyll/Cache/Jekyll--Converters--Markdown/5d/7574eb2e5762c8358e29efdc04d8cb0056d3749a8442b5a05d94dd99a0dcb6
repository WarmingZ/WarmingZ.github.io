On the <a href="https://www.soloviov.fun/about/">â€œAboutâ€</a> page you can read information about me and download my resume in a format convenient for you.
Going to the <a href="https://www.soloviov.fun/contact/">contacts page</a> you have the opportunity to fill out the feedback form and I will definitely write to you.</p>
