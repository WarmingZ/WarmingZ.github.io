I"¨<p>Hi, in this post I would like to share interesting sites with you. Some work with a neural network, and some are just coolğŸ˜‰.Consider this post as the top cool sites that vryatli once can be useful in real life, <a href="https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/"><strong>but if you like looking at cats, then why not</strong></a>ğŸ˜ (just refresh the page). In the end, I also wanted to talk a little about neural networks and what it is for a programmer.</p>

<p>This neural network transfers objects from your smartphone camera to your computer. You can click on the title and you will be taken to the site. There you will see an example of how this application works. In order to try it, you need to download the application to your phone and computer. To connect  the mobile and the desktop, you just need to login with the same method on both device. For instance if you used the â€œGoogle sign in methodsâ€, you should sign in with this methods on both devices.</p>

<p>ğŸ’¡<strong>The app is currently in closed beta testing, but you can easily fill out a google form to   give you access to pre-release testing.</strong></p>

<p>A simple neural network using the TensorFlow library. Just turn on the camera and wait a little. The longer you move in front of the camera, the better you will be cut out of the background.This is a great demonstration of how neural networks work.ğŸ¤Ÿ
I also mentioned that TensorFlow is used here. TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. 
If you are interested, you can go to the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">github project repository</a> where the source code is located and install it into your project.ğŸ’ª</p>

<p>This application uses the power of NVIDIA GPUs and deep learning algorithms to replace any portion of the image. You can upload your photo there and retouch it, or even cut out entire objects. I do not know how innovative this application is, because such functions are already provided by Google algorithms in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;hl=uk&amp;gl=US">Snapseed</a> smartphone application. In this application, you can also perform such retouching.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s still very interesting, hereâ€™s how I cut myself out of the background:

Agree, it looks good. Of course, this can be done much more carefully. Try it!ğŸ‘</p>

<h3 id="gnod---gives-recommendations-on-the-data-you-give-"><a href="https://www.gnod.com/">Gnod</a> - gives recommendations on the data you give ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥</h3>
<p>This service can help solve the problem â€œwhat to see?â€, â€œWhat to listen to?â€, â€œWhat to buy?â€, â€œWhat to read?â€ and may even recommend seeing pictures that you might like. When you get to the site, choose a category. Here are the categories to choose from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GNOD Music</li>
  <li>GNOD Products</li>
  <li>GNOD Art</li>
  <li>GNOD Literature</li>
  <li>GNOD Movies
For example, letâ€™s choose the category of movies. Gnod will ask you to fill out a short form of your preferences and based on this will make recommendations to you.ğŸ˜®</li>
</ul>
