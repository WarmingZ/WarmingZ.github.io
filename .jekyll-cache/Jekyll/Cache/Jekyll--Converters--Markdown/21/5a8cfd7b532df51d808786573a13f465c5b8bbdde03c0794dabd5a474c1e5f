<p>This neural network transfers objects from your smartphone camera to your computer. You can click on the title and you will be taken to the site. There you will see an example of how this application works. In order to try it, you need to download the application to your phone and computer. To connect  the mobile and the desktop, you just need to login with the same method on both device. For instance if you used the â€œGoogle sign in methodsâ€, you should sign in with this methods on both devices.</p>
