        <p>Hello, after looking at the statements of some representatives of Russian IT and Russian society in general about the war in Ukraine, I wanted to try to answer some of their claims and questions. I don’t know if I can convince anyone, but I will express my point of view. The article turned out to be quite simple and superficial because I tried to cover the most common questions, so I did’t manage to look deeper.</p>

<center>

<hr />

<p>After watching an interview with Yegor Bugaenko for the youtube channel “In the Office” I came across some of Yegor’s arguments about the war in Ukraine and the situation in general that was unfolding around and in Ukraine itself. If someone is not familiar with Egor, he is a representative of the IT community in Russia. Also, according to Yegor himself, he was born in Ukraine in the city of Dnepropetrovsk and left the country at the age of 23. Egor has worked in many places and managed to travel around the world, but now, for the last 5 years, Egor lives in Moscow and works at Huawei.
I am writing this post because, as it seems to me, I can counter some of the arguments Yegor said about Ukraine in this interview. I also urge you to try to understand the position of the hero.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/War2/Pol.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>From the beginning, Egor said that in Russia, in particular in Moscow, the society is not so politicized in comparison with Ukraine. And this is true,going up to a person on the street and asking him what he thinks about such and such a political situation, 80% of respondents will tell you their points of view. But is it really that bad? Ukraine, all the time to be between two opposing forces, has experienced many Maidans and presidents.
Almost all the years of independence, the society wanted changes, the proof of this is the change of power. I will not analyze the Maidan of 2014, but after, as I believe, the unsuccessful rule of Petro Poroshenko, people chose Zelensky. At that time, society wanted a more centric president. You can watch Zelensky’s interview before his presidency and make sure of my words. That is, there was a demand from society for change, which was shown by the 2019 elections. And I repeat, a request for a legitimate change of power and bloodless changes. Another question is that the reforms were carried out for a very long time, but the formation of such a large and multinational country never happens quickly. I think this is clear to everyone, although perhaps someone will be able to parry my arguments.</p>

<h4 id="rejection-of-anothers-opinion">Rejection of another’s opinion</h4>

<p>Further, Yegor speaks about not accepting a different position, a different opinion, which can radically differ from the opinion of the interlocutor. On this account, I would like to say that such a phenomenon is observed not only in Ukraine, and not only in this country, people hang labels on a person. Taking the Russian society as a whole, which, by the way, hangs labels no worse than the Ukrainian one, and listen to the opinion of the Russian about the Ukrainian, I don’t think that we will hear anything good.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/War2/Tuzla.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>Yes, for many years we were considered brothers, but at the same time they sold us gas at exorbitant prices and had views of the island of Kos Tuzla, back in 2003. And that’s just what I can remember. Also, let’s pay attention to the linguistic features, when Russians constantly say “in Ukraine”, explaining this by the fact that Ukraine as such did not exist and it was “on the outskirts” which is absolute nonsense. Since Kyiv existed when there was a swamp on the site of Moscow. You can also read historical summaries of the term Oukraina on the Internet, I also think when they say “on”, then this country is going to war. As it happened, Russia went to war with Ukraine.
But it is worth paying tribute to Yegor, he was not talking about Ukrainians, but about people in general.</p>

<h4 id="about-russian-and-ukrainian-languages">About Russian and Ukrainian languages</h4>

<p>Egor gives several arguments about the Ukrainian language, which, it seems to me, are due to Ukraine’s long stay in the Soviet Union. We perfectly understand what language children were taught in schools and what language the Ukrainian Soviet government spoke. Egor cites the words of Vaserman as an example, who stated that the Ukrainian language during its existence could not form from the southern dialect of the Russian language into an independent language. The author of the opinion also speaks of “Surzhik”, calling it an intermediate language, which is between Russian and Ukrainian. But I will not describe the phenomena of “Surzhik”, I would like to comment on the words about the unformed language. Based on historical events, one can understand why so few people speak Ukrainian. I believe that this is precisely the consequence of Russia’s policy for all the years of its existence. I also urge you to study the Russian language before the period of the revolution, before the Bolsheviks abolished the language. It will also be interesting to study the appearance of the first institutions and graduates of these institutions.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/War2/sssr.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>Let’s pay attention to the words about “Surzhik”. Do 100% of Russians really speak a pure Russian dialect? If we start to explore the issue of dialectics, we will come across a greater number of so-called “surzhiks” than in Ukraine. I do not know the specific percentage of people who speak a dialect, but based on the size of the territory of Russia, we can conclude that not everyone speaks pure Russian. So I don’t think the “surzhik” argument is that good. I urge you to also study the linguistic issue in the Kuban and take a closer look at the names of villages in the Belgorod region, it seems to me that if you carefully study this issue, you can find a lot of interesting things.</p>

<p>It is worth understanding one thing, the Ukrainian language is the cultural heritage of Ukrainians and should be the state language. Otherwise, we will continue to follow the same path as before and say that the Ukrainian language could not develop into an independent one. Since the Ukrainian language is the state language, this language should prevail in schools and universities and in politics. Let’s fantasize and imagine that in Russia they are allowed to speak Ukrainian and teach Ukrainian in schools? You ask, why? In Russia, the Russian language, which Ukrainians were forced to speak for many years, by the way. But when a person living in a country does not know the state language, how to call such a person? Egor says that it is rather difficult to learn such a language as Ukrainian, and here I do not agree, you just need to learn it and try to speak it. Just like learning other languages.</p>

<p>My opinion on this matter is as simple as possible, maximum preferences for the Ukrainian language, freedom for Russian. If they go back a little higher and read my arguments about Zelensky’s election, it can be repeated again that people wanted a centric government that would take a less radical approach, including to the language issue. And this issue was resolved, but for a long time, but hard, but in the end of development it could have been resolved if Russia had not crossed everything out with its invasion of a foreign country.</p>

<img src="/img/posts/War2/surzhik.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>Just as everything Yegor brings to the account of the ban on everything Russian in Ukraine can be applied to Russia itself. But for some reason these bans are better than in Ukraine. Quite a lot has also been said about freedom of speech and that Yegor advocates that it generally does not exist in any state. With which, in principle, I agree, but again, in Russia for Yegor, for some reason, censorship is better than in Ukraine. Perhaps I somehow did not understand the words of the author of these words, but I got the impression.</p>

<h4 id="ukraine-bombed-donbass-for-8-years">Ukraine bombed Donbass for 8 years</h4>

<p>This thesis seems very interesting to me. This question is asked by the majority of Russians, as if justifying their actions in relation to Ukraine. This is not the only “argument” that is voiced towards Ukraine. The Russians mention that Ukraine wants to join NATO and Russia does not want to see alliance bases near its borders. And this also has an explanation. But let’s start with eight years of bombing the Donbass and the question of where we have been all these years.
This question can also be asked to the people of Russia, but where were you for 8 years? Why were you silent while “we bombed Donbass”? And who has destabilized the situation in these regions all these years?</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/War2/Donbas.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>By the way, since 2017 Ukraine has wanted to introduce peacekeeping forces in the occupied regions. However, such plans have not been implemented so far due to the ambitions of the Russian government and Putin’s efforts to carry out a UN peacekeeping mission on favorable terms. The fact is that Ukraine and its Western allies have differing views with Russia on the mandate of such a UN mission.</p>

<p>In particular, the Ukrainian position was that peacekeepers should be in the entire occupied territory, while Russia wanted to deploy peacekeeping units only on the line of demarcation. It is clear that it was not profitable for Putin to give peacekeepers de facto control at the border, because the pseudo-republics would simply fall apart without supplies of food, ammunition and, most importantly, financial infusions.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/War2/UN.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>Didn’t your government supply weapons there? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Girkin">Girkin</a>, he and the company, after the capture of Crimea, without an order from the military authorities, went to raise a wave of protest in the regions of Donbass. And by the way, all these people who took part in the operation to seize the Crimea and other regions were not regular military personnel of the RF Armed Forces. Do you think it is possible to draw an analogy with the oprichnik’s, Ivan Grozny ( Ivan the Terrible)? I think that these citizens even surpassed their historical ancestors, since the guardsmen at least stood in the ranks of the oprichnik’s.
By the way, I urge you to look at the statistics of the shelling of Donbass by the Ukrainian military, and you will be very surprised to see this number since 2019 (starting from Zelensky’s presidency). They may also object to me and ask why we did not comply with the Minsk Agreements. The answer will be simple, these agreements were created deliberately, impracticable. They were not beneficial both for the Russian Federation and for Ukraine, and everyone perfectly understood that no one would fulfill them.</p>

<p>The Russian oligarch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Malofeev">Malofeev</a> also allocated money for arming the so-called “DNR” . It’s also just a fun fact. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Pugachev">Sergey Pugachev</a> who was very close to Putin, all the money of the oligarchs is the money of Putin personally, who can simply order what to buy and where to finance.
So is it really that the majority of people living in the regions of Donbass really wanted to go to Russia so badly? We will never know the answer to this question.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/War2/Nato.webp" alt="Network" class="responsive" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</center>

<p>And what about NATO? I believe that America as a whole has made little effort to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. The endless struggle between Russia and America has brought us to this point. Only Russia shows us unjustified imperial ambitions. If someone does not people Russia, she will make you love her by force. It is also an interesting question, but would Ukraine want to join NATO if Russia had not pursued such a bloody policy? Let’s look at the number of “armed conflicts” involving Russia that I can highlight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Ossetian-Ingush conflict began in 1992 and remains unresolved to this day.</li>
  <li>Armed conflict in Transnistria in 1992.</li>
  <li>The first Chechen war of 1994-1996.</li>
  <li>Dagestan war 1999.</li>
  <li>The Second Chechen War 1999 - 2009.</li>
  <li>Armed conflict in South Ossetia in 2008.</li>
  <li>Annexation of Crimea in 2014.</li>
  <li>“Military operation” of the Russian Federation in Syria since 2015.</li>
  <li>Civil war in the Central African Republic in 2018, where the Russian Federation sent its troops in support of the current government.</li>
  <li>And the invasion of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>And to this, any Russian will answer something like “but how many wars has America unleashed?”. And this will be the standard justification of their state. But interestingly, it turns out that the Russians hate America and call it bloodthirsty, when they themselves do the same thing. So how are you different from the “bloodthirsty Americans”?</p>
